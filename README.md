###Download-Videos
download the embedded videos in websites with just two clicks on Android. 

The procedure is pretty simple-:
1) Download termux from playstore.
2) Download the script.sh available in this repository to your Download folder in the internal storage
3) Open Termux and type "termux-setup-storage" allow it file permissions 
4) Further type "cd storage/downloads/"
5) Now just run the script using the command "sh script.sh"
6) After the process has been completed you'll get a message saying the same.
7) Now just go to any website(youtube, facebook, reddit etc), tap the share button then on termux and the video file will be downloaded in the download_vids destination in your internal storage.
